# Springboot-RabbitMQ-Communication
A basic exposure to RabbitMQ communication between Microservices

## What is this?
This is a simple demo project created using Springboot which utilizes a non-http(s) way of communication between the Microservices. This might be useful to others or to my future self. There are hundreds of tutorails which explain about communication b/w Microservices using HTTP but felt this is not exposed much so here we are.

## What does it include?
1) Communication using RabbitMQ
2) Slapped a decent AES Encrpytion/Decrpytion algorithm which helps secure the data while communicating
3) Single Microservice which contains Producer and Consumer (may it be the readers wish to implement these separately) 

## What is planned next?
I will be constantly updating this repo with more useful information that I might learn and document it using this repo. This will definitely help others and also myself once I return back to this field after a few days.

Planned Features Include:
1) Implementing Google Protobuf to provider data serliazation
